    This is a special app instance that allows us to perform database operations
    without going through the app's migration_needed check. Running this script
    is functionally equivalent to what `flask db` normally does. The reason we
    can't continue to use that is that command is that it invokes the app instance from
    FLASK_APP env variable (natlas-server.py) which performs the migration check and exits
    during initialization.
