        <p>The default search behavior is to search the "nmap_data" field, which is the raw output produced in the <code>.nmap</code> file. This can be overridden by prepending specific field names to searches, such as "ctime:" or "port_str:". For a complete list of field names, please see the json export of a scan. Currently, Natlas only supports searching the latest results for every host and does not offer the ability to search historical results.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default operator is AND, but can be overridden using "OR"
            <ul>
              <li><code>22 80</code> would search for results with both strings "22" AND "80" in them</li>
              <li><code>22 OR 80</code> would search for results with the string "22" OR "80" in them</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Look for exact string matches by wrapping the term in quotes
            <ul>
              <li><code>"22/tcp"</code> returns results in which the exact string "22/tcp" appears</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use "!" to exclude results
            <ul>
              <li><code>!ssh</code> to filter out results containing the string ssh</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Search for specific ports using "port_str:"
            <ul>
              <li><code>port_str:22</code> shows hosts with port 22 identified as open</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Search for specific tags</li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>tags:corpnet-a</code> shows hosts tagged in the "corpnet-a" range</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Search for results with screenshots: <code>screenshots:*</code>, or alternatively use <code>num_screenshots:>0</code></li>
          <li>Search time ranges by using the "ctime:" keyword
            <ul>
              <li><code>ctime:&lt;2019</code> to search for results before January 1st, 2019</li>
              <li><code>ctime:2019-01-01</code> to search for results from January 1st, 2019</li>
              <li><code>ctime:>2019-01</code> to search for results newer than January 1st, 2019</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Put it all together now:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>ctime:>2019-01 tags:corpnet-a port_str:22 !OpenSSH</code> shows us results from corpnet-a that are newer than January 1st, 2019, listening on port 22, but do not contain the string "OpenSSH" in them
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li><strong>Search historical results</strong> by appending <code>&includeHistory=1</code> to the end of the query string in the URL bar. Searching history through the search box is not currently supported.</li>
        </ul>
