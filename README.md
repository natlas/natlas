# Summary

You've got a lot of maps and they are getting pretty unruly. What do you do? You put them in a book and call it an atlas. This is like that, except it's a website and it's a collection of nmaps. Natlas' objective is to make it easy to perform continuous scanning and review collected data.

The goal of Natlas is not to identify a bunch of vulnerabilities, necessarily, but rather to identify exposure. Perhaps you want to make sure that no one is running ssh with password auth enabled. Or perhaps you want to look for any exposed nfs, smb, or rsync shares. Maybe you want to look for expiring or expired ssl certificates, or weak ssl ciphers being used. Since Natlas uses the popular [nmap](https://nmap.org) port scanner, you can easily use any default nmap scripts in your scans.

# Getting Started

To get started with your own deployment of Natlas, you're going to need a minimum of one elasticsearch node, one Natlas server and one Natlas agent. The quickest way to accomplish this is to run all three of these containers on the same server. Installation instructions for the server and the agent are linked below in their associated readmes.

The required deployment order is as follows:

1) [Elasticsearch](#Elasticsearch)
2) [Natlas Server](#Natlas-server)
3) [Natlas Agent(s)](#Natlas-agent)

**Note:** As of June 15, 2020, Natlas has moved to a docker-only deployment model.

## Elasticsearch

Because the Natlas server requires a connection to Elasticsearch in order to launch correctly, you should make sure you have an Elasticsearch node available before continuing with the next step. If you've never used Elasticsearch before, follow [Elastic's instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) for setting up a single node cluster with docker. Make sure to pay attention to the section on persisting the elastic data.

## Natlas Server

The Natlas server controls agent orchestration, scan configuration, and provides search and browse for the data stored in Elastic.

See the [Natlas Server README](natlas-server#installation-production) for instructions on installing the Natlas server.

## Natlas Agent

The Natlas agent is what fetches work from the server and actually performs the scans.

See the [Natlas Agent README](natlas-agent#installation-production) for instructions on installing the Natlas agent.
