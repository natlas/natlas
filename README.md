# Summary

You've got a lot of maps and they are getting pretty unruly. What do you do? You put them in a book and call it an atlas. This is like that, except it's a website and it's a collection of nmaps. The Natlas server doubles as a task manager for the agents to get work, allowing you to control the scanning scope in one centralized place.

# Getting Started

To get started with your own deployment of Natlas, you're going to need a minimum of one server and one agent. The quickest way to accomplish this is to run an agent on the same host as the server. Installation instructions for the server and the agent are linked below in their associated readmes.

As of June 15, 2020, natlas has moved to a docker-only deployment model. Instructions for downloading and running the docker containers can be found in the corresponding component README files linked below.

To get started with development, please see [Project Setup](CONTRIBUTING.md#project-setup).

## natlas-server

The natlas-server is where the data gets stored and the web interface exists so that you can search through the data.

You can read more about setting up and running the server on the [natlas-server/README.md](natlas-server/README.md)

## natlas-agent

The natlas-agent is what fetches work from the server and actually performs the scans.

You can read more about setting up and running the agent on the [natlas-agent/README.md](natlas-agent/README.md)
